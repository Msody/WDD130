      <p>HOW TO PLAY</p>

      <ol>
        2v2 team A starts a point by hitting the ball down onto the net so it
        ricochets up towards Team B.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        3 touches paragraph paragraph-med">Teams have up to three alternating
        touches (think bump, set, spike) to return the ball to the net.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        360 degree play After the serve, players can move or hit in any
        direction.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Scoring If a team can't return the ball onto the net with their 3
        touches, their opponent scores 1 point. A shot that hits the ground,
        rim, or bounces more than once on the net is no good. First team to 21
        wins!
      </ol>
